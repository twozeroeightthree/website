<h2>Tops</h2>
<p>
  Description: An on-going series of works where collections of bottle tops are housed within a box frame. The joy comes from adhering to a process which removes the need for any decisions or thoughts concerning the aesthetic.
</p>
<p>
  The series includes examples from Dubai, Mumbai, London and Madrid - it is the products and subsequent colour of the tops that come from these distinct locations, each with their unique conditions, that ultimately inform the final piece -  each one, in a small and insignificant way, is an anthropological study of a period of time linked to a location and daily habits.

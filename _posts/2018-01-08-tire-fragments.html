<h2>
  Sheikh Zayed Road _ E11<br>
  Tire fragments
</h2>
<p>
  Description: A daily commute by road between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, during a three month period, lead to making stop-offs to collect fragments of tires. The tyres are often imported from beyond the Middle East and are suseptible to the heat conditions of the region which results so often to their fragmentation.
</p>
<p>
  These fragments are presented in isolation or as a collective, in a way that avoids any permanent, irreversable change to their physicality.

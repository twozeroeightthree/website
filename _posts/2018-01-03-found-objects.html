<p>
  Description: Found objects or fragments are presented in isolation or as a collective.

  Humble in origin, the work attempts to present common, familiar objects and materials for reappraisal- never permanently or irreversibly fixed - they are presented in a way that avoids any contamination and minimises the act of intervention.

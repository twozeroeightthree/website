<h2>Packing tape cones</h2>
<p>
  Description: A conical form, made from a single length of spiralling packing tape, held in place by a single elastic band.
</p>
<p>
  The form, though stable, has a fragility due to the tension present within the nature of the tape and its structure. This means that the overall form can be altered/adjusted through careful handling and manipulation.
</p>
<p>
  The tape has a degree of transparency which lends a diffused glow to the surface of the form when a light source is housed within.

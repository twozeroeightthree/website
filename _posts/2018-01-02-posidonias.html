<h2>Posidonias</h2>
<p>
  Description: Posidonia Oceanica (commonly known as Neptune grass or Mediterranean tapeweed) is a plant that grows only in the Mediterranean and Caribbean seas.
</p>
<p>
  The plant releases tiny fibres which, during their journey to reach the shore, bind together to form small, hairy pebbles. These pebbles are collected and joined to create a large single necklace.
</p>
<p>
  A strand of the plant was discovered to measure 8 kilometres in length and has been growing for at least 100,000 years - making it the biggest and oldest living organism in the world today.

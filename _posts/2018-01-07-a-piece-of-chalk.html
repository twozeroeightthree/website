<h2>A piece of chalk</h2>
<p>
  Description: Adopting a consistent approach for each piece of chalk where the surface of each is reduced to a seamless series of convex polygons. Although an entirely handmade process - the finished forms share an aesthetic quality more associated with a digital context.
</p>
<p>
  The material for these pieces comes from the River Thames at low-tide from small, exposed seams of chalk. The chalk is primarily a pure form of limestone (calcium carbonate) formed from the shells of microscopic marine algae around 100 million years ago.
